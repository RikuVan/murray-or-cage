# Gofore Helsinki React / Redux Workshop Sprint 0

## Why you gotta do this
The workshop will be much more effective and fun if you have already started to think about how apps built
with React, Redux, and Redux-saga works. Moreover, we will make use of a number of helper functions and code conventions which
can be overwhelming if you have no exposure to them.

## Todo
This is a silly app, slapped together in a few hours. But it has pretty much everything we need to build
much larger and more complex apps, just in a single file: `index.js`. Spend time trying to understand how the app is built
and how data flows when the user interacts with the app. Start to form questions about parts that are unclear or
you would like more explanation about. In particular try to understand how the data flows from middleware to the reducers
and into the view, and then how interactions with the view trigger changes in the store.

Please clone the app and try it out with `yarn install && yarn start`

If you have time, try to make some changes. Maybe add a feature like keeping track of the average response time.
I be really stoked for a PR :)

This is the app until you make it better: [Murray or Cage](http://rollingkitties.surge.sh/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
